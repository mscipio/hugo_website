**Abstract**

Dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET) is known for its ability to extract spatiotemporal information of a radio tracer in living tissue. In this paper, a novel direct reconstruction framework is presented, which include concurrent clustering as a potential aid in addressing high levels of noise typical of voxel-wise kinetic modeling. Core assumption is that the imaged volume is formed by a finite number of different functional regions, and that voxel-wise time courses are determined by the functional cluster they belong to. Probabilistic Graphical Modeling (PGM) theory is used to describe the problem, and to derive the inference strategy. The proposed iterative estimation scheme provides concurrent estimate of kinetic parameter maps, activity images, and segmented clusters. Simulation studies and exploratory application to real data are performed to validate the proposal.
