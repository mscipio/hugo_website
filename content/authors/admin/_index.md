I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the **Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging** at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, working in **Ciprian Catana**'s PET-MR lab. 

My main research interest is on tomographic image reconstruction and parametric maps estimation from PET data. I am an author of several peer-reviewed publications and proceedings, mainly on: models for 4D PET image reconstruction incorporating kinetic modeling and clustering; strategies for improving maps’ SNR and accelerating voxelwise fitting via GPU parallelization; PET reconstruction algorithms for non-Poisson data.
