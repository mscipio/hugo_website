# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "We present an approach for concurrent reconstruction of respiratory motion–compensated abdominal dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)–MRI and PET data in an integrated PET/MR scanner. The MR and PET reconstructions share the same motion vector fields derived from radial MR data; the approach is robust to changes in respiratory pattern and does not increase the total acquisition time. METHODS: PET and DCE-MRI data of 12 oncologic patients were simultaneously acquired for 6 min on an integrated PET/MR system after administration of 18F-FDG and gadoterate meglumine. Golden-angle radial MR data were continuously acquired simultaneously with PET data and sorted into multiple motion phases on the basis of a respiratory signal derived directly from the radial MR data. The resulting multidimensional dataset was reconstructed using a compressed sensing approach that exploits sparsity among respiratory phases. Motion vector fields obtained using the full 6-min (MC6-min) and only the last 1 min (MC1-min) of data were incorporated into the PET reconstruction to obtain motion-corrected PET images and in an MR iterative reconstruction algorithm to produce a series of motion-corrected DCE-MR images (moco_GRASP). The motion-correction methods (MC6-min and MC1-min) were evaluated by qualitative analysis of the MR images and quantitative analysis of SUVmax and SUVmean, contrast, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and lesion volume in the PET images. RESULTS: Motion-corrected MC6-min PET images demonstrated 30%, 23%, 34%, and 18% increases in average SUVmax, SUVmean, contrast, and SNR and an average 40% reduction in lesion volume with respect to the non–motion-corrected PET images. The changes in these figures of merit were smaller but still substantial for the MC1-min protocol: 19%, 10%, 15%, and 9% increases in average SUVmax, SUVmean, contrast, and SNR; and a 28% reduction in lesion volume. Moco_GRASP images were deemed of acceptable or better diagnostic image quality with respect to conventional breath-hold Cartesian volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination acquisitions. CONCLUSIONS: We presented a method that allows the simultaneous acquisition of respiratory motion–corrected diagnostic quality DCE-MRI and quantitatively accurate PET data in an integrated PET/MR scanner with negligible prolongation in acquisition time compared with routine PET/DCE-MRI protocols.
