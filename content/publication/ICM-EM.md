# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "We propose and test a novel approach for direct parametric image reconstruction of dynamic PET data. We present a theoretical description of the problem of PET direct parametric maps estimation as an inference problem, from a probabilistic point of view, and we derive a simple iterative algorithm, based on the Iterated Conditional Mode (ICM) framework, which exploits the simplicity of a two-step optimization and the efficiency of an analytic method for estimating kinetic parameters from a nonlinear compartmental model. The resulting method is general enough to be flexible to an arbitrary choice of the kinetic model, and unlike many other solutions, it is capable to deal with nonlinear compartmental models without the need for linearization. We tested its performance on a two-tissue compartment model, including an analytical solution to the kinetic parameters evaluation, based on an auxiliary parameter set, with the aim of reducing computation errors and approximations. The new method is tested on simulated and clinical data. Simulation analysis led to the conclusion that the proposed algorithm gives a good estimation of the kinetic parameters in any noise condition. Furthermore, the application of the proposed method to clinical data gave promising results for further studies."
