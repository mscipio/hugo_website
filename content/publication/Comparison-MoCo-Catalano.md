abstract = "PURPOSE: To compare the clinical performance of upper abdominal PET/DCE-MRI with and without concurrent respiratory motion correction (MoCo). METHODS: MoCo PET/DCE-MRI of the upper abdomen was acquired in 44 consecutive oncologic patients and compared with non-MoCo PET/MRI. SUVmax and MTV of FDG-avid upper abdominal malignant lesions were assessed on MoCo and non-MoCo PET images. Image quality was compared between MoCo DCE-MRI and non-MoCo CE-MRI, and between fused MoCo PET/MRI and fused non-MoCo PET/MRI images. RESULTS: MoCo PET resulted in higher SUVmax (10.8 ± 5.45) than non-MoCo PET (9.62 ± 5.42) and lower MTV (35.55 ± 141.95 cm3) than non-MoCo PET (38.11 ± 198.14 cm3; p < 0.005 for both). The quality of MoCo DCE-MRI images (4.73 ± 0.5) was higher than that of non-MoCo CE-MRI images (4.53±0.71; p = 0.037). The quality of fused MoCo-PET/MRI images (4.96 ± 0.16) was higher than that of fused non-MoCo PET/MRI images (4.39 ± 0.66; p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: MoCo PET/MRI provided qualitatively better images than non-MoCo PET/MRI, and upper abdominal malignant lesions demonstrated higher SUVmax and lower MTV on MoCo PET/MRI."
