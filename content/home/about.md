# About me

I am an Italian Biomedical Engineering Ph.D. student. My main research interests, at the moment, include tomographic image reconstruction for medical imaging (mainly PET and MRI), and kinetic modeling of dynamic acquisitions with a specific focus on parametric maps generation.

During the first two years of my Ph.D., I have been dealing with theoretical and computational issues, related to the previously mentioned topics. Working with pharmacokinetic modeling basically means working with **non-linear optimization** and fitting of complex **ODE-based compartmental models**, while including this metabolic information into the reconstruction of 4D PET/MRI time series required me to develop and implement **hierarchical Bayesian models**. Giving the particular nature of the problem of parametric mapping, I have also had the chance to get in touch with **CUDA GP-GPU programming**, with the aim of efficiently parallelize the problem of fitting a specific model to every voxel of a 3D PET or DCE-MRI volume.

My *alma mater* is the ***University of Pisa***, in Italy, but I also spent part of my Ph.D. at the ***Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging***, in Boston, and I am still working with them, above all with the two groups mainly involved with PET/MR: [Catana Lab](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/user/7025), and [Price Lab](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/user/3482467).
