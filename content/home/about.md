# Biography

I am an italian Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering. My main research interests, at the present moment, include tomographic image reconstruction for medical imaging (mainly PET and MRI), and dynamic studies with a specific focus on kinetic modeling and parametric maps generation.

During the first years of my Ph.D., I have been dealing with problems of non-linear optimization and fitting of complex ODE-based compartmental models, as well as with the development of hierarchical Bayesian models, both from a theoretical and computational point of view. Giving the particular nature of the problem of parametric mapping, I have had the chance to get in touch with CUDA GP-GPU programming, with the aim of efficiently parallelize the problem of fitting a certain model to all the voxel of a 3D PET or DCE-MRI volume.
